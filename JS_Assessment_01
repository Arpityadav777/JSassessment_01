/*
Assessment Requirements
1. Create a variable that can hold a number of NFT's. What type of variable might this be?
2. Create an object inside your mintNFT function that will hold the metadata for your NFTs. 
   The metadata values will be passed to the function as parameters. When the NFT is ready, 
   you will store it in the variable you created in step 1
3. Your listNFTs() function will print all of your NFTs metadata to the console (i.e. console.log("Name: " + someNFT.name))
4. For good measure, getTotalSupply() should return the number of NFT's you have created

// solution :

// Created an array named: Employee_NFTs that will store all the created NFTs
const Employee_NFTs = []

// created an object(Employee_NFT_object) that will store the metaData of the NFTs
// on line 27 i have used push() function to store this object in the array(Employee_NFTs)
// on the next line i have printed that the NFTs is created Succesfully

function mintNFT (E_NFT_id, E_NFT_name, E_NFT_age, E_NFT_ethnicity,  E_NFT_job_title, E_NFT_dressing_style, E_NFT_salary) {
const Employee_NFT_object = {
    "Id": E_NFT_id,
    "Name": E_NFT_name,
    "Age": E_NFT_age,
    "Ethnicity": E_NFT_ethnicity,
    "Job Title": E_NFT_job_title,
    "Dressing Style": E_NFT_dressing_style,
    "Salary": E_NFT_salary,
}
Employee_NFTs.push(Employee_NFT_object)
console.log("Sucessfully minted "+ E_NFT_name +" with ID : "+ E_NFT_id)
}

// created a for loop that will go through the array(Employee_NFTs) of Employee NFT's
// in line 37 i have printed the metaData of the NFTs

function listNFTs () {
for (let i = 0; i< Employee_NFTs.length; i++){
    console.log(Employee_NFTs[i])
}
}

// created a function that will print the total number of NFTs created
function getTotalSupply() {
console.log("Number of NFTs created are : " + Employee_NFTs.length)
}

// Calling the function mintNFT, listNFTs, getTotalSupply
mintNFT("001", "Arx", "18", "Indian", "NFT Creator", "Y2K", "$0")
listNFTs()
getTotalSupply()
